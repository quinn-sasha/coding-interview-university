# Algorithm analysis

- O(...) is an upper bound
  - when T(n) = n, g(n) can be $n_2, n_3, ...$ because it satisfies the definition
- Sigma(...) is an lower bound
  - when $T(n) = nlogn$, g(n) can be n or even smaller
- Sigma is a tight bound
- To prove T(n) is not O(g(n)), use proof by contradiction
- To prove $T(n) = O(g(n))$, you just have to show there exists integers c, $n_0$ such that satisfies the definition of big O.

- Insertion sort: runtime
  - n - 1 operations
  - n operations in the worst case => $O(n^2)$
